   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-data-solutions-lv.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd dynamic-data-solutions-lv
Install a browser (if not already installed): Make sure you have a default browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) that can open HTML files.

How to Use the Makefile
The Makefile automates the process of building, running, and cleaning the website. Below are the available commands:

Build the Project:

bash

$ make
# This command creates a web directory and copies the Dynamic_Data_Solutions_LV.html and style.css files into it. This organizes the project structure for deployment.

# Run the Website:

bash
Copy code
make run
This command opens the website in your default web browser. Ensure that a browser is installed and configured as the default on your system.

# Clean Up the Project:

# bash
# Copy code
# make clean
# This command removes the web directory, cleaning up the project structure.

### Notes:
- Make sure to update the repository link under "Clone the repository" with the actual URL if you plan to upload it to GitHub or any other version control platform.
- The instructions for running `make run` assume you're using macOS or Linux. If you're on Windows, you might need to adjust the `Makefile` to use `start` instead of `open`.

This `README.md` provides a clear and concise guide for setting up, building, and running your website.
