# Web_Dev Documentation

# A Makefile can automate tasks such as building, running, and cleaning up your website project. Below is a basic Makefile for your website that covers some common tasks:

Makefile
makefile

# Variables
HTML_FILE = Dynamic_Data_Solutions_LV.html
CSS_FILE = style.css
WEB_DIR = ./web

# Targets
.PHONY: all clean build run

# Default target
all: build

# Build target - organizes HTML and CSS into the web directory
build:
	mkdir -p $(WEB_DIR)
	cp $(HTML_FILE) $(WEB_DIR)/
	cp $(CSS_FILE) $(WEB_DIR)/

# Run target - opens the HTML file in the default browser
run: build
	@echo "Opening the website..."
	open $(WEB_DIR)/$(HTML_FILE)

# Clean target - removes the build directory
clean:
	@echo "Cleaning up..."
	rm -rf $(WEB_DIR)
Explanation:
Variables:

# HTML_FILE and CSS_FILE point to your HTML and CSS files.
# WEB_DIR is where the built files will be placed.
# Targets:

# all: The default target that calls build.
# build: Copies the HTML and CSS files into a web directory, organizing the project structure.
# run: Opens the HTML file in your default browser (works on macOS and Linux; for Windows, use start).
# clean: Removes the web directory to clean up the build.

# How to Use the Makefile
# Save the code above in a file named Makefile in the root of your project directory.
# Open a terminal in your project directory and run:
# make or make all: Builds the project.
# make run: Opens the website in your default browser.
# make clean: Cleans up the build directory.

This setup automates the process of building, running, and cleaning your website files, making it easier to manage.
